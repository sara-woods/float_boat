 Web app based on renting and letting out boats.
 
### [Floatify](https://floatifyapp.herokuapp.com)

## Project outline

During the final weeks of the Le Wagon Web Developemtn bootcamp we were given the task of creating an Airbnb like clone for our first collaboration project, and so we decided to base it on boats.

The entire website was built from scratch by us over a simple rails boilerplate. It was designed, developed, deployed and presented all within 5 days.

We took the following process:

1.  Created  **user stories**
2.  Outlined  **user actions**
3.  Created a model  **schema**
4.  Outlined necessary  **routes/controllers**
5.  Decided  **team workflow** and began coding
6.  [Luke Billings](https://github.com/lukebillings) presented mid-project on the Wednesday
7.  Improved the app based on feedback
8.  [Gabriel Hardy-Françon](https://github.com/xotw) presented the final project on the Friday

Everyday we discussed our progress, decided what needed completing for the day, and then divided the tasks.

## How it works
